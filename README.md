# Task Manager
This project was developed as part of *The Odin Project Curriculum*. Link to the project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list/project_submissions?page=1

Itâ€™s a simple, modern project management app built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage, ensuring privacy and persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **Create Projects:** Organize your work into multiple projects.
- **Add Tasks:** Add tasks to any project, with title, notes, and due date. 
- **View task details:** Click on a task to see it's notes and due date
- **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Check off tasks as you finish them.
- **Delete Projects:** Remove a project and all its tasks.
- **Persistent Storage:** All data is saved in your browser (localStorage).
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, modern interface with sidebar navigation.

## Still to be implemented
Some planned features and improvements include:

- Add a welcome/ help message 
- Add sorting for completed tasks
- Add the option to hide completed tasks
- Add option to delete individual tasks
- Add a Today view
- Task indicators: Visual cues (e.g. icons or styling) to show when a task includes notes or a due date.
- Icons: Add consistent iconography across the app to improve usability and visual design.
